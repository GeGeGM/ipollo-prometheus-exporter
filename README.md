# iPollo Prometheus Custom Exporter

## Purpose

Disclamer: Work in progress (poc working, needs to be automated)

This tool aims to export iPollos metrics (temps, fan speed) as Prometheus format in order to monitor it into Grafana.

You need:
- A Prometheus/Grafana stack already up and running
- To run this docker container on a host that's able to reach your iPollos

Once up, your Prometheus will be able to scrap the custom exporter.

[iPollo] <= [Custom_Exporter] <= [Prometheus] <= [Grafana]

## How to 

### Build Docker image

Run `build.sh` in order to build the Docker image.

### Configure your host list

Edit `config.txt` file: Add your host list to it (only working for one host atm)

### Start the docker

### Add new source to Prometheus

### Import Grafana dashboard



## TODO
- Create a systemd service
- Manage several hosts via config file
- Reload config on change
